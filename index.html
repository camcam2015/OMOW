                    Sheesh I don't know what to put here. Of course, as an extremely new website that's not even published yet (just hosted on GitHub)
                    it's not like what I'll say now matters to anyone. Maybe in the far future it will, maybe it'll inspire someone to create... but in the
                    meantime it's just me talking out of my ass. So the project: starting this month (today is 8/13/2019) I will commit to creating and
                    completing one website each month. All of them will be displayed on this website and I'll use it as a portfolio or sorts, assuming
                    I'd be any sort of hirable a few months into this :)
                </p>
                <p>To the me of the future: I believe you can do this. This website *technically* counts as your first, so good job! You're one down.</p>
